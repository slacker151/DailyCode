Problem Description:

	Check whether a binary tree is a fll binary tree.

	Reminder:
	A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which all nodes have either zero of two children nodes. Conversely, there is no node is a full binary tree, which had one child node.

Problem Solution:

	The first solution that I can come up with is to check if the node has either two child nodes or zero child node while a breadth-first-traversal using a queue and all that stuff.

	The result came out fine. This is a really easy quesiton
	
	The alternative solution would be to use recusion to solve the quesiton which does the same job.
