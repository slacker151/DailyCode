section 'section1' (offset) merged into 'section2' (offset) with different attributes

The contents of one section werer merged into another, but the attributes of the two 
sections are different. Your program may give unexpected results. For example, data 
you wanted to be read only may now be in a wriable section.

To resolve LNK4254, modify or remove the merge request.

When targeting x86 machines and windows CE targets, the .CRT section is read-only. If 
your code depends on previous behavior (.CRT sectionare read/write), you could see
unexpected beahvior.
