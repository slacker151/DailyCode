Types of Numbers:

	1. Int		 	: 0, 1, ... 100, ...
	2. Natural	 	: 1, 2, ... 100, ...
	3. Whole	 	: 0, 1, ... 100, ...
	4. Prime	 	: numbers greater than 1 which have only two 
					   factors - itself and one. 2, 3, 53, 67, 191,...
	5. Composite 	: numbers greater than 1 which are not prime 
					   numbers


Important Points on Prime Numbers:

	1. 1 is neither prime number, nor composite number
	2. 2 is the only even prime number
	3. There are 25 prime numbers under 100. 
	4. To check if a number p is a prime number, firstly, find number
		n such that n is the largest natural number which satisfies 
		n^2 <= p; next, check if p is divisible by any of the prime
		numbers less or equal to n ? not a prime : yes a prime
	5. Co-prime: Two numbers 'a' and 'b' are called co-prime if their
		highest common factor(HCF) is 1.


Divisiblility Tests:
	
	1. Divisiblility by 2: all even numbers
	2. Divisiblility by 3: if sum of all digits is divisible by 3
	3. Divisiblility by 4: if the last two digits are divisible by 4
	4. Divisiblility by 5: if the last digit is 0 or 5
	5. Divisiblility by 6: if number is both divisible by 2 and 3
	6. Divisiblility by 8: if the last three digits is divisible by 8
	7. Divisiblility by 9: if sum of all digits is divisible by 9

Division Theorem:

	1. Divident: (divisor x quoient) + remainder
	2. (x^n – a^n) is divisible by (x – a) and (x + a) for all n
		because x^2 – a^2 = (x – a)(x + a)
	3. (x^n – a^n) is only divisible by (x + a) for all odd values of
		n because x^3 + a^3 = (x + a) (x^2 + a^2 – xa)


Question:

Q1. When a number is successively divided by 2, 3, 7, we get 1, 2, 3 
	as the remainder respectively. What is the smallest such number?

A1. Think in terms of a input ->processes ->output. Now assume the 
	output to be 1, and reversely derive what the input is. 65.


Q2. When a number is successively divided by 2, 4, 8, we get 1, 1, 0
	as the remainder respectively. What is the smallest such number?

A2. See Q1 for approach. 67


Q3. Question 3 : What would be the maximum value of ‘B’ in the 	
	following equation :

		  1 2 B
		+ B 4 C
		+ C 6 7
		--------
		1 0 3 5
		--------

A3. This question is quite simple, using algbra, B+C = 8, maximize B
	minimize C, B = 8 & C = 0


Q4. Which of the following are prime numbers ?
	
		(i)   247
		(ii)  397
		(iii) 423

A4. This question is really straightforward, follow the rule.
