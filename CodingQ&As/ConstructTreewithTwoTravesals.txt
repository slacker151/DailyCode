If you are given two traversal sequences, can you construct 
the binary tree?

	It depends on what traversals are given. If one of the 
	traversal methods is Inorder then the can be constructed,
	otherwise not.

	Therefore, following combinations can identify a tree.

	InOrder & PreOrder
	InOrder & PostOrder
	InOrder & LevelOrder

	And following do not

	PostOrder & PreOrder
	PreOrder & LevelOrder
	PostOrder & LevelOrder
	PreOrder & PostOrder & LevelOrder
