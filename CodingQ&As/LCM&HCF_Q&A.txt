Factor and Multiples: 

	All the numbers that divide a number completely, without leaving 
	any remainder, are called factors of that number. For example, 24
	is completely divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24. Each of these
	numbers is called a factor of 24 and 24 is called a multiple of 
	each of each numbers.

LCM (Least Common Multiple):

	The least number which is exactly divisible by each of the given 
	numbers is called the least common multiple of those numbers. For
	example, amongest 3, 31, and 62. The LCM of these two numbers 
	would be 2 * 3 * 31 = 186.

	To find the LCM of the given numbers, we express each number as a 
	product of prime numbers. The product highest power of the prime 
	numbers that appear in prime factorization of any of the numbers
	gives us the LCM.

HCF (Highest Common Factor):

	The largest number that divides two or more number is the highest
	common factor for those numbers. For example, 30 (2 x 3 x 5), 36 
	(2 x 2 x 3 x 3), 42 (2 x 3 x 7), 45 (3 x 3 x 5). 3 is the largest number that divides each of these numbers, and hence, is the HCF
	for these numbers. HCF is also known as Greatest Common Divisor


Questions that uses alot of LCM is "work and wage" type of questions.


Q1: 
	To complete a work, a person A takes 10 days and another 
	person B takes 15 days. If they work together, in how much time will they complete the work ?

A1: 
	Let the total work be LCM (10, 15) = 30 units
	=> A’s efficiency = 30/10 = 3 units / day
	=> B’s efficiency = 30/15 = 2 units / day
	Combined efficiency of A and B = 3+2 = 5 units / day
	=> In one day, A and B working together can finish of 5 units of 
	work, out of the given 30 units.
	Therefore, time taken to complete total work = 30 / 5 = 6 days


Q2 : 
	Two friends A and B working together can complete an assignment in 4 days. If A can do the assignment alone in 12 days, in how many days can B alone do the assignment ?

A2 : 
	Let the total work be LCM (4, 12) = 12
	=> A’s efficiency = 12/12 = 1 unit / day
	=> Combined efficiency of A and B = 12/4 = 3 units / day
	Therefore, B’s efficiency = Combined efficiency of A and B – A’s
	efficiency = 2 units / day
	So, time taken by B to complete the assignment alone = 12/2 = 6 
	days
