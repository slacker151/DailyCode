Herb's Notes:

Guideline #1: Prefer to make interfaces non-virtual, using template 
				method.

Guideline #2: Prefer to make virtual functions private.

Guideline #3: Only if derived classes need to invoke the base 
				implementation of virtual function, make the virtual 
				function protected
 
Guideline #4: A base class destructor should be either public and 
				virtual, or protected and nonvirutal.
