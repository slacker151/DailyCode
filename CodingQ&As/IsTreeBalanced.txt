This boils down to a cold-stone definition, just memorize it!!

Definition:

	A balanced tree tree is defined to be a tree such that no two 
	leaf nodes differ in distance from the root(depth) by more than one.

To determine whether a tree is balanced or not, compare the difference 
between the minDepth and maxDepth of the tree. If the difference is
larger than 1, then is not balanced.
