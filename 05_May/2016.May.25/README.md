Differences between UX and UI


	Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. 
	But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves 
	are quite defferent, referring to very different parts of the 
	process and design discipline. Where UX Desing is a more 
	analytical and technical field, UI Desingn is closer to what we 
	refer to as graphica design, though the responsibilities are 
	somewhat more complex.

	There is an analogy I like to use in describing the different parts of a product:

	If you imagine a product as a human body, 
		
		bones = code => structure
		organs = UX => life functions
		cosmetics = UI => appearance

	A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for product's success.


UX Design: 
	refers to the term User Experience Design. It is a process of enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the custormer and the product. As for the analytical part of the story, UX design encompasses any and all interactions between a potential or active customer and a company. Another arguable reason being that it was just a fancy way fo reworking a practice that has already existed for hundres of years known as "Market Research". UX designed is part marketer, par designer, part project manager; the role is complex, challending and multi-faceted. You see that iteration of the product, as connected to analysis or testing is indeed mentioned twice, but in reality you would put it in between every other item on the list. Ultimately the aim is connect business goals to user's needs through a process of testing and refinement to that which satisfies both sides of the relationship.

	In conclusion:

	1. UX design is a process of development and improvement of 	
		quality interaction between a use and all facets of a company
	2. UX design is responsible for being hands on with the process 
		of research, testing, developing, content for quality
		improvement
	3. UX design in theory is a non-digital practice.


UI Design:
	referes to the tern User Interface Design. If you look at job posts for User interface design, you will mostly find interpretations of the profession hat are akin to graphical design. Sometimes extending also to branding design, and even front end development. UI designers are in charge of UI prototyping, interactive and animation, adaption to all device screen sizes, implementation with developer.

	In conclusion:

	1. User interface desing is responsible for the transference of a 
		brand's strengths and visual assets to a product's interface 
		as to best enhance the user's experience.
	2. User interface design is a process of visually guiding the 
		user througha product's interface via interactive elemtns and 
		across all sizes/platforms.
	3. User interface desing is a digital field, which includes 
		responsiblilty for cooperation and work with developers or 
		code.
