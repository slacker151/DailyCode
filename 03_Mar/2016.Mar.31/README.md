Problem Description:

	Merge sort is often preferred for sorting a linked list. The slow random-access performance of a linked list makes some other algorithms (such as quicksort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible.

	Let head be the first node of the linked list to be sorted and 
	headRef be the pointer to head. Note that we need a reference 
	to head in MergeSort() as the below implementation changes next
	links to sort the linked lists (not data at the nodes), so 
	head node has to be changed if the data at original head is 
	not the smallest value in linked list.

Problem Solution:

	Easier done than said ...
	Code speaks for itself ...
